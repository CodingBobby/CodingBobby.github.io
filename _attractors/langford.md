This attractor[^name] was found by William Finlay Langford in 1984.[^original-paper]
As the title of his paper suggests, the attractor is a bifurcation of a torus.
What does that mean?
Well, what he has done is taking a system of differential equations that resulted in a torus shape and simply added a bifurcation term to one of them.
Jokes aside, he has probably done a lot more work to get to that point but looking at the equations and tinkering with the parameters let you imagine just that.
Specifically, this term is $$\varepsilon\, z\, x^3$$ and it is added to $$\dot{z}$$.
If you leave it out by setting $$\varepsilon = 0$$, you get a spiraly donut shape[^canvas]:

The inner tube is very thin here but when decreasing $$\alpha$$ to something like $$0.65$$, the shape becomes obvious:

Now when increasing the bifurcation parameter (and keeping the original value for $$\alpha$$), the chaos begins.
Here is it with $$\varepsilon = 0.001$$ and as you can see, this very slight change pushes the system out of symmetry:

[^name]: Most online resources refer to this attractor as the "Aizawa Attractor" despite that Yoji Aizawa (it apparently got named after) seems to have nothing to do with it.[^aizawa] How this confusion arose is unclear.

[^aizawa]: This was pointed out by: E. Fleurantin, J.D. Mireles James, 2019. \"Resonant tori, transport barriers, and chaos in a vector field with a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation\". Department of Mathematics, Florida Atlantic University.
