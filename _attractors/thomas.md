Originally proposed by the biologist RenÃ© Thomas (1928--2017), this set of differential equations is cyclically symmetric.[^original-paper]
The constant $$b $$ is a bifurcation parameter that describes how dissipative the system is.
Dissipation is a property from thermodynamics that can be thought of as a kind of dampening which is the result of a loss of energy, i.e. in form of heat.
Depending on the value of $$b $$, the attractor changes its shape.
Here is a list of what happens:

- $$b \ge 1$$: origin is a stable point
- $$1 > b \gtrsim 0.329$$: two stable points
- $$0.329 > b \gtrsim 0.208$$: two stable oscillations
- $$0.208 > b > 0$$: mostly chaos
- $$b = 0$$: no dissipation, brownian walk into infinity

There are several particularly interesting values for which more than just one attractor stabilise seperately:

- $$b = 0.22$$: two cycles
- $$b = 0.19$$: single cycle
- $$b = 0.17$$: three cycles
- $$b = 0.13$$: three cycles
