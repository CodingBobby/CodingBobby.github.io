  <p><strong>Congratuations!</strong></p>
  <p>You found nothing.</p>
  <p>
	  But what does nothing mean?
	  Clearly, there is something; you are just reading this.
	  So you didn't find nothing, you found something that you thought might be nothing.
	  Or actually, you wanted to find something.
	  But you couldn't find something, so you found nothing but instead you found this â€“ something.
  </p>
  <p>
	  So what now?
	  I don't know.
	  And you probably don't know either.
	  Because you didn't expect to find something instead of nothing instead of something you originally wanted to find.
	  Maybe, you didn't even know what to find here because you came here, not knowing what to find.
	  But you thought you will find something.
	  Not this something but something else that is not nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
	  Anyways, something must be wrong as you didn't want to land here.
	  Sorry.
	  But thanks for coming.
