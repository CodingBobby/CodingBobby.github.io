When studying fluid dynamics and heat transfer I learned about chaos and the attractors.
My first encounter was with the Lorenz attractor, of course (read [this blog post](/blog/beautiful-chaos)).
The pure beauty of its unpredictable but organic shape hooked me from the first minute â€“ I believe this feeling will stay with me forever.

So here is a small collection of rather simple but in a way artistic renderings of attractors I made for fun.
Click on the images to find out more about them.
