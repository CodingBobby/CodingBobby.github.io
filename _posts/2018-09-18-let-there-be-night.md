The heavy-metal song *Let There Be Night* by Powerwolf was first released on the album *Blessed & Possessed*[^blessed-possessed] by Napalm Records in 2015.

Attila Dorn -- the vocalist of the band -- is known for singing lyrics partly in latin (e.g. *Lupus Dei* in the same named album from 2007).
In *Let There Be Night* the chants are sung in a different language tho.
Most sources say its Hebrew but if you compare it with it's corresponding verses in the Bible (Genesis 1:3)[^genesis] you're not finding any similarities with the sound of the vocals.
Speaking of that, the actual lyrics for those strophes aren't written anywhere.
Metal enthusiasts and fans of Powerwolf know the language as "Attilaian" which he made up by himself and most likely cannot be understood by any other person.

Most recently in 2018, an official cover of the song was published on the second CD of the limited deluxe edititon of the album *The Sacrament Of Sin*[^sacrament-of-sin].
In this cover by Kissin' Dynamite, all lyrics are in English language.
You could expect the verses to be a more or less 1:1 translation of the Attilaian lyrics as the line counts and lengths match pretty good.
Unfortunately those aren't written anywhere as well.

So I've done some research and repeated listening to come up with some usable lyrics.
You can find the original Attilaian and the cover's translation side by side here:

| Blessed & Possessed | The Sacrament Of Sin |

| Let there be night <br> God bless the father, the son <br> Let there be night <br> And day be gone <br> Let there be night <br> The mass of dark has begun <br> Let there be night <br> And damn the sun | Let there be night <br> God bless the father, the son <br> Let there be night <br> And day be gone <br> Let there be night <br> The mass of dark has begun <br> Let there be night <br> And damn the sun |
